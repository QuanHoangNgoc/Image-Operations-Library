### About
This project focuses on the development of a sophisticated **image operations library**. In its initial release, the library offers comprehensive functionalities, including:
- **Image Loading**: Capability to read, resize, scale, and convert image modes.
- **Image Analysis**: Tools to compute and visualize image information such as image plotting, histogram plotting, and distance computation between image matrices.
- **Feature Extraction**: Support for extracting various image features like histogram features, Sobel sum features, and HOG features.
- **Image Transformations**: Includes functionalities to convert images to Sobel images, HOG images, and perform adaptive histogram equalization.
- **File Operations**: Introduces the FileOps class to facilitate operations with files, including listing all files in a specified directory.

### Show-off
- [x] **Watch the [Youtube Demo](https://youtu.be/EcjI4TKktR4?feature=shared)**
- [x] **Explore the [Kaggle Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/quanhoangngoc/imlib/notebook)** for a hands-on demonstration.

# Repo Structure
- **LIB**: Central repository for all developmental progress, housing the primary library module.

# Pipeline
- **Classes and Functions**: Organized into three key classes:
  - **ut**: Facilitates messaging, notes during execution, and debugging.
  - **Imops**: Core module for comprehensive image operations.
  - **FileOps**: Provides support for various file-related operations.

# How to Install This Project
- **Clone** the **LIB** branch of this repository and **import *lib.py*** to begin utilizing the module's functionalities.
