### about 
- This is the project where we develop a library about **image operations**. In the first version of the library we support functions like: 
	- *Load image from file* (read, resize, and scale image as well as convert mode of image) 
	- Besides, the library helps compute and plot a lot of information about images such as: plot image, plot histogram of image, compute distance similar between 2 image matrixs. 
	- Specially, support extract some feature types from the image such as: *histogram feature, sobel sum feature, and hog feature*. 
	- It also supports im2im functions such as: to *sobel image, hog image, and equalize (adaptive) histogram image*. 
	- We also build a FileOps class to help perform operations with files as list all files in the root directory.

# Repo Structure:  
- LIB: contains all development progress including the library module. 
# Pipeline:   
- Build 3 classes with corresponding functions: 
	- ut: to send message, note while running as well as watch to debug
	- Imops: the main class of th√≠s module 
	- FileOps: support some ops with files. 
# How to install this project: 
- Clone the LIB branch of this repository and then import *lib.py* to use functions of the module. 
# Donate: 
- If this project is useful, please like (star) to add motivation for me. 
- I am happy to share my knowledge and projects to people. I am willing to spend more time, enthusiasm and a well-groomed appearance for these projects. Thank you for your help
