### about 
- This is the project where we develop a library about image operations. In the first version of the library we support functions like: 
	- Load image from file (read, resize, and scale image as well as convert mode of image) 
	- Besides, the library help compute and plot a lot of information about images such as: plot image, plot histogram of image, compute distance similar between 2 image matrix. 
	- Specially, support extract some feature types from the image such as: histogram feature, sobel sum feature, hog feature. 
	- It also supports im2im functions such as: to sobel image, hog image equalize (adaptive) histogram image. 
	- We also build a FileOps class to help perform operations with files as list all files in the root directory.

# Repo Structure:  
- LIB: contains all development progress including the library module. 
# Pipeline:   
- Build 3 classes with corresponding functions: 
	- ut: to send message, note while running as well as watch to debug
	- Imops: the main class of th√≠s module 
	- FileOps: support some ops with files. 
# How to install this project: 
- Clone the LIB branch of this repository and then import lib to use functions of the module.
