### About 
Welcome to the Image Operations Library, where we empower developers with robust image processing capabilities. Our initial release includes essential functions such as:
- **Load Image from File:** Read, resize, scale, and convert image modes.
- **Compute and Plot Information:** Visualize images, generate histograms, and calculate similarity distances between image matrices.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extract key features like histograms, Sobel sums, and HOG features from images.
- **Image-to-Image (im2im) Transformations:** Perform transformations such as Sobel filtering, HOG image generation, and adaptive histogram equalization.
- **File Operations (FileOps Class):** Facilitate file operations, including listing files in the root directory.

# Repository Structure 
- **LIB:** Contains all development progress, including the core library module.

# Pipeline 
Our project pipeline involves building three essential classes with corresponding functions:
- **ut:** Provides messaging, notes, and debugging support during execution.
- **Imops:** The main class driving all image processing functionalities.
- **FileOps:** Supports various file operations within the module.

# Installation Guide 
To integrate our library into your projects:
- Clone the `LIB` branch of this repository.
- Import `lib.py` to start using the library's extensive functionalities.

# Support and Donation
